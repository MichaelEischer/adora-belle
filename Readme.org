** Synopsis

A simple helpdesk tailored for use in remote-only university exercises:
Students can request help, this will lead to a new request being created,
along with an link to a jitsi-instance that tutors will visit to answer the
students question via webconf.

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
stack run adora-belle
#+END_SRC

This will start an instance listening at port 8080.

Visit =http://localhost:8080/index.html= for the student interface, and
=http://localhost:8080/admin.html= for the admin interface. Currently,
accounts are hardcoded for the demo (until I know what authentication this
may be plugged in), passwords are: =user{1..8}= with password =pw= and
=admin{1..3}= with password =admin=.


** State

Hastily thrown together during the corona crisis as a demo. For production
use, the authentication should be replaced (no more hardcoded credentials :p).
